# CarCruiseTally
A simple car cruise vote tallying calculator that takes ballot input and displays the top winners

### Usage

This application takes user input ballot data (based on the ballot.jpg form) that is handed out to car show participants, and calculates the winners of the popular vote. The organizer of the car show this was written for had the following requirements:

1. Each car show entrant gets one ballot, they can fill out any and all information on the ballot.
2. Ballots are not required to have all fields filled out
3. A way to exclude certain cars from appearing in the Top 20 List should be available.

For #3, a list of any cars Excluded in the Exclude box will be ignored in the calculation. Sometimes special awards are given out or other circumstances prevent the cars from being eligible (eg an organizer's car or a one-off special award). This application also allows the user to undo the previously entered ballot, and export all of the entered data to a .csv to keep after the show, in case it is needed after the fact for something.
